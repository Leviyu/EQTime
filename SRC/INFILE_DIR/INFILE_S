<PHASE>								S
	# Phase name
<COMP>								T
	# Component, choose from T/R/Z
<filter_flag>						bp
<Frequency_range>					0.01	0.1
	# bp means bandpass filter,frequency_range defines the corner frequency 
	# of the bandpass filter, with the first one being the low corner and the 
	# second one being the high corner in Hz
<DIST_MIN_MAX>						30 70
	# minimum / maximum distance 
	# only stations with the distance range would be processed
# ============================================================================


<DIST_DELTA>				        1
	# Distance stack increment for record section distance stack 
<LONG_BEG>  						-100
	# large window begin time relative to PREM in seconds
<LONG_LEN>  						200
	# large window length in seconds
<PHASE_BEG>  						-10
	# phase window begin time relative to PREM in seconds
<PHASE_LEN>  						50
	# phase length in seconds
<NOISE_BEG>  						-100
	# noise window begin time relative to PREM in seconds
<NOISE_LEN>  						80
	# noise window length in seconds
<velocity_or_displacement>  		velocity
	# velocity / displacement
	# whether to process records in velocity domain or displacement domain




# === SNR CCC CUT parameter ==== #
<SNR_CUT>							2.1
<CCC_CUT>							0.92
	# SNR threshold and CCC threshold
	# records with SNR smaller then SNR_CUT  and CCC smaller then
	# CCC_CUT would be classified as bad records



<POLAR_SOLUTION>					2
	# Discarded flag
