<PHASE>								S

<filter_flag>						bp
<Frequency_range>					0.01 0.0667
	# bp means bandpass filter,frequency_range defines the corner frequency 
	# of the bandpass filter, with the first one being the low corner and the 
	# second one being the high corner in Hz
<DIST_MIN_MAX>						30 non
	# minimum / maximum distance 
	# only stations with the distance range would be processed

<NOISE_LEN>  						80
	# noise window length in seconds
	# velocity / displacement
	# whether to process records in velocity domain or displacement domain




# === SNR CCC CUT parameter ==== #
<SNR_CUT>							2.1
<CCC_CUT>							0.92
	# SNR threshold and CCC threshold
	# records with SNR smaller then SNR_CUT  and CCC smaller then
	# CCC_CUT would be classified as bad records
